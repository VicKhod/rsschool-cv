## About me

In May 2022, I successfully completed a six-month Frontend Developer training program
at SberUniversity and received a diploma of additional professional education.

In my work, I like to see the result of my work, find solutions to mistakes, work in
team to solve problems together.

My main interest for today is to deepen my knowledge in development, close gaps and become a better specialist.
